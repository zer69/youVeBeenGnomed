Shader: 

  The Shader is not such easy to use, for that reason we have prefabs with ready made flames-You have to balance 
many parametries in order to get what you want so don't expect to have a new style of flame with one trigget. The 
main direction we can give you is that the Partical_Systems are for the shape of flame and the Turbulences are for the
movement.

  Some tips for the use:

a) Play with the scales.
b) Use two flames as one.
c) Play with the color.
d) In Main_Flame use the scales [x: 0.2 , Y: 0.6 , Z: 0.2] to have a Candle_Flame.
e) Hit the rate from the Particale_System_2 to zero, play around with the Partical_System_1 until you create your
   result and then enable again the Particale_System_2 in order to adjust it.




For the Fire_Props:

  The prefabs in the file Scene_Examples are in 2k textures only, if you want to use 4k textures you have to use
the prefabs in 4k_prefabs file in the begining file and insert the flames manually. Everything in the beginning file 
(2k_Prefabs_URP, 4k_Prefabs_URP & Flame) will be at zero [0 Rotation & Position] and one 
[1 scale, except FireBall-Wind_Flame_Torch-Flame_Torch] so propably it will looks like one at first look but it isn't. 
We don't have less resolution because you can change it inside in Unity but if you find it useful suggest it us to the 
comments or e-mail us and we will update the package with 1k textures and less. 
  The prefabs are only in URP, for HDRP you have to set it up on your own. There are the HDRP textures in the package 
but not in prefabs form. Use the FBX files and insret the materials with the HDRP textures. If you buy the package for
HDRP use please let us know so we can improve the package in the next update.
